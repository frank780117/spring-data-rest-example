# spring-data-rest-example
It's example for spring data rest with jpa, include CRUD and association.

I reference [oreilly rest example] [oreilly rest example] and modify entity to show all function for spring data rest.

Spring data maybe has bug or no instinct function for assiciation, I try fixed it and you can use Postman(chrome plugin) to
do all example. The Postman collection is dump on file 'postman-collection', you can import easy.
